Rotary encoder library for Arduino, based on code from http://www.circuitsathome.com/mcu/reading-rotary-encoder-on-arduino

Original author: Oleg Mazurov
Modified to fit into an Arduino library.

The code contained is optimized to run well on an Arduino.  It doesn't use interrupts, it must be polled at a fast rate.
